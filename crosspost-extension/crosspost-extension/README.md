## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** → select the `chrome-extension` folder
5. Click the extension icon and configure each service

---

## Setup

### 🦋 Bluesky
- Go to [bsky.social](https://bsky.social) → Settings → Privacy and Security → **App passwords**
- Create a new App Password and enter it in the extension settings

### 🐘 Mastodon
- Go to your instance → Settings → Development → **New Application**
- Copy the Access Token and enter it in the extension settings

### 🧵 Threads
1. Create an app at [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Add the **Threads API** product
3. Get a long-lived access token (valid for 60 days)
4. Get your User ID:
   ```
   GET https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/me?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
5. Enter both values in the extension settings
6. Use the **「更新」(Refresh)** button before the token expires

### 📦 catbox.moe (for Threads image posts)
No setup required. Images are temporarily uploaded to [catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe) to obtain a public URL, then posted to Threads. Once Threads fetches the image, it's stored on Meta's CDN — catbox.moe is only needed at the moment of posting.

---

## How it works

```
Twitter/X post
    ↓ Click tweet button (crosspost checkboxes checked)
    ├── Bluesky  — direct blob upload via API
    ├── Mastodon — direct blob upload via API  
    └── Threads  — blob → catbox.moe (public URL) → Threads API
```

All three platforms are posted in **parallel** for maximum speed.

## Checkbox behavior after posting

| Result | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| All success | Checkboxes reset to default settings |
| Partial failure | Failed platforms stay checked (easy retry), succeeded platforms unchecked |
